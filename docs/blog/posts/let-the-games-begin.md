# Let the games begin

Hello hello! My name is Kuba Sejdak. I’m a C++ software engineer for over 7 years. Today I realized, that I have a need
to share my C++ journey with the world. So I decided to start a blog.

<!-- more -->

In fact, this is not my first time. Over a year ago I tried to start another blog focused around usage of C++ in the
embedded systems. I didn’t have much knowledge to share at that time. My idea was to start an ambitious embedded project
and document everything on the blog. This way I would have been forced to go deeper into the subject and fully
understand things. The reality was harder than I thought. This topic is so advanced and so niche, that I was doing only
the R&D part. Website was left alone until the next payment for the hosting. Finally I decided to stop that madness and
abandon the blogging stuff.

Now I don’t want to focus on the particular thing. I will write only about things that I know, when time is right. No
pressure. Let’s see how will that go. I’m sure it will be much better. Wish me luck and I hope to see you soon! Let the
games begin!
