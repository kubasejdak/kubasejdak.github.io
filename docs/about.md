# About Me

Hi! My name is Kuba: I do designing and programming in C++ for a living. After hours I admire its beauty and work on
projects in both high-level and embedded domains.

## Bio

I started coding before the high school. From the first days I knew, that C++ will play a tremendous role in my carrier.
After 12 years nothing changed. In my professional work I had a chance to participate in projects from various sectors:

- industrial factories,
- smart TVs,
- PLC (Power Line Communication) networks,
- energy meters,
- gas meters,
- proprietary operating systems,
- UI applications for marine electronics,
- plasma power supplies.

Some of them followed the best programming practices, but the others were just unmaintainable pieces of crap. Also,
project management approaches varied from democracy, through constitutional monarchy up to tyranny. All those
experiences shaped me as a mature software engineer capable of handling projects until the happy end.

C++ has entered a phase of a rapid evolution and has become exciting as never before. Ben Parker from Spider-Man once
said:

    "With great power comes great responsibility."

This statement is especially important in post-C++98 era. When I started this blog I had an ambition to share all my
observations and tips, that I learned in my daily work. I hope that it will help both me and you in being a better
programmer.

If you have any questions, concerns or proposals for topics to write about â€“ contact me directly. I will be thrilled to
learn something new and share that with you in simple words.

## Private life

You canâ€™t just live to work! Besides computers and technologies I am a big fan of Star Wars and Marvel movies. The first
one are accompanied by an enormous expanded universe world described in nearly 200 books that I collect and read
one-by-one ðŸ™‚ If I really have to go out, then I run or ride my Yamaha FZ6 Fazer around the Poland.
