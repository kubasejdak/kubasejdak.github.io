# Services

Thanks for trusting me. I believe in working in a way, that I won’t have to be ashamed of it in the future. I will make
every effort to meet all your expectations. Don’t hesitate to share your coding problems and needs with me. If I can’t
help you, then I will point you to someone who can and I trust.

## Offer

I am available for hire in the following domains:

- software development (big & small projects):
  - UI applications (C/C++, Qt, UML),
  - embedded systems,
  - backend,
- architecture and design,
- refactoring and modernizing,
- project feasibility and estimation,
- training,
- consulting,
- project management,
- technology selection,
- establishing/enforcing coding standards,
- code reviews,
- static analysis.

## Contracts

I am open to both time & material and fixed-price contracts. However, the preferred choice is dependent on individual
needs and constraints. The rule of thumb is: the more is known in advance and relies only on me, the more I’m for the
fixed-price projects.

## Location

Currently I’m unable to move permanently outside Poland. This is why my relocation and traveling is very limited. My
preference is to work 100% remotely. On the other hand I understand how important it is to meet in person, get to know
each other and discuss project details before the actual work begins. If needed, I can arrange:

- kick-off meeting (at client site or in arbitrary location),
- remote meeting/conference call,
- periodic meetings.

## Contact

If you have any questions or you want to discuss the business possibilities, just send me a short notice. I will respond
as quick as possible. Looking forward to hearing from you!
